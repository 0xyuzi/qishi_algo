# Divide and Conquer

## Merge-Sort
- [Python implementation](./merge_sort.py)
- Divide the whole list into two halved size list
- sort each halved list
- then merge two sublists into one by comparing their values

## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
- [Python implementation](./lc_105_construct_binary_tree_preorder_inorder.py)
- Use the properties of preorder and inorder of binary tree transverse
    - preorder: root at the first location
    - inorder: the left side of the root is left subtree, right side of the root is right substree
